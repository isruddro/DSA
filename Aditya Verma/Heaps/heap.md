Heap:
1. k
2. smallest / largest

   * k + smallest = maxheap
   * k + largest = minheap (min will come on top and we will reamove that and rest will be largest on bottom!)

Why heap?

Sorting is normally O(nlogn) but when using heap its O(nlogk)

* We will keep putting array element in the heap and using max or mean heap, element will be on top and we will delete
  with the conditions of k range.
